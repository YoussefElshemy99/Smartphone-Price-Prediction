Logistic Regression – Modeling Step

Preprocessing Techniques:

-The dataset was checked for missing or null values and cleaned during preprocessing.
-Feature scaling was applied in the preprocessing stage to ensure all numerical features were on the same scale.
-The target variable (price_range) was separated from the input features.
-The dataset was split into training and validation sets to allow proper model training and evaluation.

Data Analysis and Visualization:
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand feature distributions and relationships.
-Correlation analysis and visualizations were used to study how smartphone features affect each other.
-Features such as RAM, battery capacity, and internal memory showed a strong influence on the price range.

Model Used:

-Logistic Regression was applied as a supervised learning algorithm for multi-class classification.

Hyperparameters Used:

-Regularization strength (C): 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0
-Maximum number of iterations (max_iter): 1000
-Optimization solver: lbfgs
-Multi-class handling method: auto

Additional Techniques to Enhance Results:
-Hyperparameter tuning was performed by testing multiple values of the regularization parameter.
-Validation accuracy was used to select the best-performing Logistic Regression model.

Final Conclusion:
Logistic Regression was successfully used as a baseline classification model for smartphone price prediction and its performance was compared with more advanced models such as Random Forest.
