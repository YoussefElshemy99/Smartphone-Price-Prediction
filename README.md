# Smart Phone Prices Prediction

## 📌 Overview

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a smart phone is considered "Expensive" or "Non-Expensive" based on its hardware specifications. This project covers the full Data Science lifecycle: Data Cleaning, EDA, Model Tuning, and Deployment via a Streamlit GUI.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Visualized feature distributions.
-   Identified correlations between key smartphone specifications.

## 🤖 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistics Regression
- Naive Bayes
- KNN

### Hyperparameters Explored

A brief comparison of performance was made to explain how particular
hyperparameters affected results.

## 🧪 Evaluation

Models were evaluated on the test set using: Accuracy, Precision,
Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

The best-performing model was selected based on these metrics.
